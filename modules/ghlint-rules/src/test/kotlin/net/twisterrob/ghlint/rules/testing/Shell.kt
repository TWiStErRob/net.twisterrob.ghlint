	 * This method relies on being called from specific test methods. The indentation is tailored for them.
	 * The `nl` variable contains indentation for both Kotlin test code and yaml.
	 * To make it work for both actions and jobs, the tests needs to use the fact that arrays don't need to be indented:
	 * ```yaml
	 * steps:
	 *   - run: echo "Test"
	 * ```
	 * is the same as:
	 * ```yaml
	 * steps:
	 * - run: echo "Test"
	 * ```
	 * However, conventionally the first one is preferred.
