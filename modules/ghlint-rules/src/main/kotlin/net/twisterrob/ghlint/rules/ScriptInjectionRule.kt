				Using ${'$'}{{ }} in shell scripts is vulnerable to script injection.

				In most cases this is a security vulnerability, but at the very least it's a bug.
				All user input must be sanitized before being executed as shell script.
				
				The simplest way to achieve this is using environment variables to pass data as inputs to `run:` scripts.

						Directly using the output in the shell script is vulnerable to script injection.
						Depending on the actual contents of the result

						 * in normal cases, the output is just wrong,
						 * in the worst case, this could lead to arbitrary code execution.
						
						In this example, the output is:
						```log
						/home/runner/work/_temp/d3ddaaab-5e34-4eb3-be73-4e830012fe4e.sh: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `)'
						Error: Process completed with exit code 2.

						echo "Warning: Quotation mark (") needs a pair."

						where
