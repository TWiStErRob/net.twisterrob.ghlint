				Action doesn't allow fast fail, and therefore black-listed.
				
				From its documentation:
				> If there are no changes (i.e. no diff exists with the checked-out base branch),
				> no pull request will be created and the action **exits silently**.
				> -- [README](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request#action-behaviour)
				
				This is error-prone: if the PR content generation **accidentally** breaks, there's no way to detect it.
				PR creation step just passes as if everything is all right.
				There are outputs from the action which could be checked for null/empty/undefined,
				but any user of this action needs to be aware of this.
				This is akin to [C's numeric return codes](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_error_handling.htm),
				the world has moved away from that approach.
				
				There's also confusion as seen [in the issue list](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request/issues?q=is%3Aissue+%22is+not+ahead+of+base%22+%22will+not+be+created%22).
				
				The only way to notice this is by checking the logs of the action:
				```
				Branch 'to-create' is not ahead of base 'main' and will not be created
				```
				and this line is not even a warning.
				
				Without the ability to fail fast, this action is not fit for production usage.
				
				The recommended replacement is [`gh pr create`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_pr_create),
				which is a first party GitHub CLI tool with behaviors fit for the GitHub Actions environment.
