				always() does not mean what you might think it means.

				Most of the time, we just want to use `if: success() || failure()`,
				for example to upload test reports, when tests failed.
				
				Implying `cancelled()` via `always()` is risky when the step affects something external.
				If someone manually cancels a workflow run, they explicitly expressed they don't want its effects to happen,

				Using a negated status check function is confusing.
				Being explicit helps in understanding the intent of the condition.
				
				If someone has read the documentation, they might understand what `!failure()` actually means,
				but being explicit comes at almost no cost and helps everyone immediately understand the intent:
				```
				if: ${'$'}{{ success() || cancelled() }}
				```
				
				_Aside: In the unlikely event that GitHub introduces a new status check function,
				half of the negative usages will get invalid.
				You never know if your condition will be in the right half._

				Note the documentation recommends:

				> use the recommended alternative: `if: ${'$'}{{ !cancelled() }}`
				> -- [Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions#status-check-functions)

				use `if: ${'$'}{{ success() || failure() }}`, it's much clearer, isn't it?
