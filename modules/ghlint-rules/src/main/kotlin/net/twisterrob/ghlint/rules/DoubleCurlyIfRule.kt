				Omitting, or over-using the double-curly-braces (`${'$'}{{ }}`) can lead to unexpected behavior.
				
				While the [GitHub Actions Expressions documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/expressions)
				has a note for `${'$'}{{ }}` being optional for `if:`s.
				The `if:` being an exception also has an exception,
				as [documented on conditionals](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-conditions-to-control-job-execution).
				
				The optionality listed above probably causes more problems than keystrokes it saves,
				and therefore it's strongly recommended to always wrap the full `if:` condition in `${'$'}{{ }}`.
				
				If you find the examples confusing (I definitely did), the more reason to always use it.
				Simple rule, consistent outcomes.

						Simple comparison is non-commutative due to YAML syntax.
