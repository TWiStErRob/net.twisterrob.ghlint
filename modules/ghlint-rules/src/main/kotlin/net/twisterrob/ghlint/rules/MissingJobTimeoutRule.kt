				Timeouts are important to prevent stuck jobs from blocking the workflow.
				
				The [default value](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idtimeout-minutes)
				is 360 minutes, which means 6 hours.
				This is usually too long for most jobs, and should be set explicitly to a lower value.
				
				Fun fact: 360 minutes is actually a hard limit on the job length, and not a friendly default.
				
				This should save resources:
				 * You'll get an error faster in case something is stuck.
				 * You'll get less [billed minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions#minute-multipliers) because of used minutes.
				   Especially important on macOS (10x) runners.
				 * Other jobs will be able to run due to [concurrency limits](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration#usage-limits).
				 * You'll contribute to a greener planet due to less data-center usage.
