# GitHub Actions validator

This is a CLI utility to **semantically** validate GitHub Actions workflows files.

## Why?

There are many [other tools](#alternatives) checking the syntax of YAML files,
or validating against the [SchemaStore github-workflow shema][schemastore-workflow],
but none of them are tailored for easily writable custom semantic rules.
This tool aims to fill the gap.

It is heavily inspired by
[detekt](https://detekt.dev/),
[PSI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/psi.html),
and [Object Calisthenics](https://www.google.com/?q=Object%20Calisthenics).

## Features

* [x] Validate the syntax of the workflow YAML files via JSON-schema
  (this is required for other steps).
* [x] Hand-crafted semantic rules and strongly typed object model.
* [ ] Opinionated workflow file formatter.
* [x] GitHub Action to make it easier to select which files.
* [ ] Support for the full workflow syntax.
  Hopefully via generated code based on the JSON-schema.
* [ ] Custom third-party rules (plugins)
* [x] action.yml validator via JSON-schema
* [x] action.yml semantic rules
* [ ] support for other types (e.g. issue templates/forms)

## Usage

* See [Usage documentation][usage] for a quick start.
